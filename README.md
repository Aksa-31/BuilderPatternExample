# BuilderPatternExample

This project demonstrates the Builder Design Pattern in Java using a `Computer` class.  
The Builder pattern is used to create complex objects step-by-step with a clear and readable approach.

## What is the Builder Pattern?

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects using a builder class.  
It helps to construct objects with many optional attributes without creating large constructors with many parameters.

##  Files in the Project

- Computer.java: Contains the `Computer` class and its static inner `Builder` class.
- TestBuilder.java: A test class that shows how to create different  configurations using the builder.
